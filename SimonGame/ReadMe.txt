Simon is a Memory game that playes an increasing sequence of colors as the user is prompted to repeat them and as the correct order of the colors is inputed the sequence increases the colors until the the user inputs the wrong order.

the interface file for this game requires no external files to run. the game code is included in the same file. all is needed is a gosu friendly enviroment and the game should work.

the game has prompts the user to press space to start, once space is pressed the game strats by playing the first color. once the user clicks the correct the right color played, the game playes the following order of colors and adds points to your score while displaying incouraging messages.

the game doesn't have sound and if a color is selected before the space is pressed the game breaks. those are the only things that i haven't gotten to fix that i am aware of.
